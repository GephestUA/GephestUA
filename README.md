# Dmytro Lypa - Front-end Developer

I am a Front-end Developer with over 4.5 years of experience in building high-performance web applications using **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. I have a strong passion for UI/UX improvements, maintaining clean and scalable codebases, and enhancing team productivity through continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

## Key Strengths
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed and implemented modular, reusable UI components, reducing development time and improving maintainability.
- **API Integrations**: Built efficient data fetching logic with REST and React Query (TanStack), optimizing load times and ensuring seamless synchronization.
- **Team Leadership & Mentorship**: Led small teams of 2-3 developers, conducted code reviews, onboarded junior developers, and fostered a culture of best practices and continuous learning.

I am always eager to learn and implement new technologies to enhance both team productivity and user experience.
